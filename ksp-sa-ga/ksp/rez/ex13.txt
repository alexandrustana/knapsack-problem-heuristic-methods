For each i = 8, 10, 50 and 100, compare the three elements of S[] SA - i . The difference between them  must reside in the different sets of control parameters that youâ€™ve chosen for each of the three runs  (initial temperature, temperature  length, cooling ratio). Draw a conclusion about the influence that  each control parameter has on the final result

 /*The bigger the gap between the initial temperature and the temperature length is the more accurate the result is.
   * The accuracy the result is mostly affected by the cooling factor. A high cooling factor means that the temperatures
   * will drop down fast and solutions will be missed. On the other hand a low cooling factor will ensure a more granular
   * approach and will offer much more solutions.*/
