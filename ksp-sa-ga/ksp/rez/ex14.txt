For each i = 8, 10, 50 and 100, compare the three elements of S[] GA - i . The difference between them  must reside in the different sets of contr ol parameters that youâ€™ve chosen for each of the three runs  (population  size,  number  of  iterations,  crossover  rate,  mutation  rate,  cloning  rate).  Use  relevant  sets of values to measure the impact of a large population size combined with a small number of  i terations, or a small population size combined with a large number of iterations on the quality of  the  solution.  Another  direction  that  you  should  study  refers  to  the  optimal  ratio  of  crossover,  mutation and cloning. Should crossover rates be very high com pared to mutation rates, or should  they be more evenly distributed? Draw the necessary conclusions
