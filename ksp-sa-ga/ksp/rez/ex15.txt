Use  the  results  obtaine d  du ring  solving  requirements  #10,  #11,  #12,  #13  and  #14 to  draw  a  conclusion  about  advantages/disadvantages  of  using  simulated  annea ling  or  genetic  algorithms  instead of neighborhood search or backtracking

/*15*/
  /*The advantage of using a Backtracking algorithm is that the algorithm ensures that the solution is always the best.
   * Although this best solution comes with the cost that the call stack explodes if the Data Set is not small, thus making
   * the algorithm feasible to use only for small data sets.
   * The Neighbourhood Search algorithm on the other hand can be used with much bigger data sets, because it doesn't
   * find the best solution exhaustively. The algorithm after a number of iterations quits and returns the best solution
   * found so far. The problem with this algorithm is that it can get stuck in a local solution.
   * The Simulated Annealing algorithm has the advantage that it doesn't get stuck in a local solution but because it only
   * uses a single "population" as input the chances for it to offer the best solution are smaller than the chances for
   * the Genetic Algorithm to offer the best solution.
   * The Genetic Algorithm or the Simulated Annealing algorithm although they don't offer all the time the best solution
   * they can still offer better solutions than the Neighbourhood Search algorithm(which can get stuck) or the Backtracking
   * algorithm which can easily explode the call stack.*/
