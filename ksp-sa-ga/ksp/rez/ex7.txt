Use  the  results  obtained  during  solvi ng  requirements  #5  and  #6  to  draw  a  conclusion  about  advantages/disadvantages of using neighborhood search instead of backtracking

/*7*/
  /*Although backtracking algorithm offers the best solution for the problem at hand it is quite restrictive regarding
   * the size of the data set (i.e. the algorithm takes O(2^n) time to complete), thus making it impossible to use with
   * quite small data sets(e.g. 100 entries). On the other hand the neighborhood search algorithm does not have this
   * size constraint and also it doesn't overflow the call stack (i.e. for storing its neighbours it uses the heap stack)
   * but it also doesn't find all the time the best solution.*/
